The number guessing game algorithm in JavaScript involves a series of steps to create an interactive experience for the user. 
Hereâ€™s a detailed description of how the algorithm typically works:
 Game Initialization
  Generate a Random Number: 
   The game starts by generating a random number within a specified range. 
   This is done using the Math.random() function, which produces a floating-point number between 0 and 1, multiplied by the range size, and then rounded down to the nearest whole number.
   Set Up Variables: 
    Initialize variables to keep track of:
     The random number to be guessed.
     The number of attempts made by the user.
     An array to store the user's guesses for display purposes.
 User Interaction
  User Input: 
   The game prompts the user to enter their guess. 
   This can be done through an input field in a web interface. 
   The input should be validated to ensure it is a number within the acceptable range.
 Check Guess:
 Correct Guess: 
  If the user's guess matches the random number, display a congratulatory message indicating success and provide feedback on the number of attempts taken.
 Incorrect Guess: 
  If the guess is incorrect, check whether it is higher or lower than the target number:
 If the guess is too low, inform the user and allow them to try again.
 If the guess is too high, inform the user similarly.
 Track Attempts: 
  Each time a guess is made, increment the attempt counter and store the guess in an array for future reference.
Game Continuation
 Repeat or End Game: 
  The game continues until the user guesses correctly or decides to stop playing. 
  If they reach a maximum number of attempts without guessing correctly, inform them that they have lost and reveal the correct answer.
 Restart Option: 
  After completing a game (either winning or losing), provide an option for the user to restart the game. 
  This involves resetting all variables and generating a new random number.
